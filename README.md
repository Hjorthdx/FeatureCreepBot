# FeatureCreepBot
A rewrite of the python DiscordFeatureCreepBot.

The main objective of this bot is for me to learn TypeScript. <br/>
In addition I've set up the goal for myself that I really want to learn testing. Therefore all features that's being made on FeatureCreepBot should be fully tested before moving on to a new feature. This is what happend with the Python version, where a lot of bugs were constantly discovered that I had to go back and fix. I hope to solve issues like these by having every feature tested before release.

## How to run? <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/Hjorthdx/FeatureCreepBot`

`cd FeatureCreepBot`

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run start`
